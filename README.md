# Project-Rock-Paper-Scissors
# Project: A Rock, Paper, Scissors game program built using JavaScript

## What is the project?
The Rock, Paper, Scissors project is a game program designed to allow the user to play against the computer, all within a web browser. The concept is based upon the game where two individuals each pick one of the aforementioned objects.

When both individuals have picked an object, they are compared against each other to determine the result, either being: a win, a loss, or, a draw. The conditions to determine the result are as follows: rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, paper beats rock, while matching objects results in a draw.

All of this will be played from within a web browser console, and only JavaScript will be required for this program at this stage.


## Plan
    1. User picks an object.
    2. Computer picks a random object.
    3. The user’s object is compared to the computer’s.
    4. A decision is made to determine the result.
    5. A message is displayed to the console to inform the user of their pick, the computer’s pick and the game result.
